This is an add-on developed while I was working at the Office of Global Serices at New York University. The published add-on is only available to members of the NYU community. 

The use case is very simple: sometimes staff get or share spreadsheets in Google Drive that have N-numbers (student ID numbers) in incorrect formats. For example, a student with the N-number N12345678 might type it as N-12345678 or n12345678 on a form. When N-number Checker is run, it will correct the formatting of any number it can and highlight any that it cannot fix.
